# CraneGvn
A project to develop and explore tools to mix and use Svn and Git.  
  
## ★Origin of software name
The official name of this software is "CraneGitversion"  
That name is a fusion of Git and Subversion.  
Also, Crane is not a machine, but a bird's "crane"  
It symbolizes that it is a tool made in Japan.  
  
## ★Project policy
The goal of this project is to create and disseminate tools that can be handled in the same way without being conscious of Svn and Git.  
In order to achieve this goal, we will mainly focus on how to implement and create tools and release packages.  
Also, for popularization, software created in this project is provided free of charge (welcome donation).  
  
### ■Software development policy
The software created in this project is subject to the following policy.  
- Various interfaces should be based on Svn.
- During development, we will proceed with implementation in the order of "CUI version" → "CUI+ version" → "GUI version". ※１

※１：This is because you can start to make from CUI intensively develop each part,  
　　　as a result, you can create good quality software.
